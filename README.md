# CubeMarching
Mini Unity project implementing 3D Cube Marching

Project implements 3D Cube Marching (Compute Shader) with triplanar shading.

It uses port of [gnoise](https://github.com/TheTryton/gnoise/tree/NET) to C#.

Aim of this project was to create a sandbox game similar to astroneer however I abandoned it.
